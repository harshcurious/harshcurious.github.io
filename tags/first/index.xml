I had read the time series portion of it during a work project, and put it on my to read list. I am finally getting around to it and I am really enjoying it so far. If you need like a quick overview of a lot of stats ideas this is great.
If you have seen stat/math like it and want a quick referesher/introduction than great.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 8</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 13:05:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til8/</guid><description>Go 101 This sets more realistic expectations about Golang.
About Go 101 Main selling point of Golang:

Great cross-platform support. Vibrant group. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how this particular book is useful.
