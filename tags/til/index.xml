Difference between a person who is a therapist and who helps other people with their problems. Training; expertise; limitations. If a therapist can&amp;rsquo;t stream on Twitch, then under qualified people will do that job of giving advice. The more qualified you are, the less you are allowed to do the public advice action.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 13</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til13/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 17:06:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til13/</guid><description>India&amp;rsquo;s Covid-19 Emergency The situation is scary. Very scary. It has spread to the rural areas. There is severe lack of information and resources. There are a lot of quacks who can wreak havoc in the current climate of misinformation. The biggest fake Guru Ramdev has shown his true colors by blaming the victims of Covid-19 for all their breathing issues. We have RSS workers followed by our honorable PM dying without treatment.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 12</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til12/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 13:17:46 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til12/</guid><description>Learning Kotlin Creating variables Notes from: https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/variable-types and
You can define variables dynamically:
var firstname = &amp;#34;Harsh&amp;#34; var lastname = &amp;#34;Kumar&amp;#34; var age = 26 var happiness = 0.1 You can specify the type:
var firstname:String = &amp;#34;Harsh&amp;#34; var age:Int = 43 Kotlin variables can be declared in two ways:
val: Immutable. var: Mutable. Basic variable types (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html)
Numerical types: 6 built-in types
Byte: values between -128 and 127 Short: values between -32768 and 32767 (16-bit signed two&amp;rsquo;s complement integer).</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 11</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 12:19:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til11/</guid><description>Python List Operations If we start with a list

It is a universal model of computation. Alternative to a Turing Machine.
Until the 1960s, the lambda calculus was only a formalism. Since Richard Montague and other linguists&amp;rsquo; applied it in understanding the semantics of natural language, the lambda calculus has gained popularity in both linguistics, and computer science.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 9</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til9/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 12:49:06 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til9/</guid><description>Go 101 Continued The simplest Go program:
package main func main() { } The first line package main specifies the package name (main here) of the containing source file.
I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand this statement.
Let me go back to the other book I was reading (Go in action). There I found the following statement:
For the build tools to produce an executable, the function main must be declared, and it becomes the entry point for the program.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 7</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:12:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til7/</guid><description>Banana Pi M5 Learned of its existence from Explaining Computers Has onboard eMMC storage.

Couldn&amp;rsquo;t access the article ðŸ˜ª This sounds very interesting AdaFruit Lately I have been really interested in using more sensors and display for my Raspberry Pi, but everything is so f**ing expensive. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can buy anything. One thing I definitely am going to try is make a pir activated night light using Pico and Led matrix.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 5</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 11:17:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til5/</guid><description>Open Source Smart Watch Very similar to another project I have already heard about called the Watchy Made by Paul Smith with news over at Hackster.io. The project has a website and a GitHub organization. It has got a micro-USB port for data transfer and charging. The main one has a SD-card slot for data storage. The lite one has no SD-card slot. The components used are: EPS32-micro-D4: 2Ã—240 MHz, 320 KB RAM Bluetooth 4.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 4</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 09:37:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til4/</guid><description>Industry TV series Just brilliant. The complexities of all the relationships and actions is well thought out. The decisions made were well suited to the characters. It was all around just a well made show. I am impressed. Would recommend to all most anyone. The only point against it is that it has a very cynical worldview

Violent Monkey : Kinda like greasemonkey or tampermonkey. Open source. Let&amp;rsquo;s you run userscripts (basically Javascript assets) to change functionality on a website. It is getting updated regularly on github. LocalCDN : This could be rather interesting especially if I can do it on my pi hole. For now I have added it to Brave via the unofficial build for chromium browsers.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 1</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 19:46:43 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til1/</guid><description>The second wave of coronavirus is here in India I read this article from indian express in the morning. The daily cases yesterday were over 50000 for the first time since November. There are reported cases of multiple new variants (in a situation were DNA sequencing is extremely rare).
The situation is frightening, especially some of the new variants being able to evade the immune system much more efficiently. I have been wearing a mask in public spaces at all times, but nobody else seems to be interested in doing so.</description></item></channel></rss>
