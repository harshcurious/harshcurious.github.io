I have used the popular static site generator Hugo. Hugo is based on the language go. Disclaimer: this is the second time I am creating my website using Hugo. But the last time I created this was in 2015, so a lot has changed.
Installing Hugo on Windows 10 My recommendation is to use Chocolatey to install Hugo although there are binaries available at github for direct installation.</description></item><item><title>FranklinFail</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/franklinfail/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 17:56:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/franklinfail/</guid><description>Trying to make Frankin work on Windows 10</description></item></channel></rss>
