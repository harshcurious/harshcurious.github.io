My rating: 5 of 5 stars
I enjoyed it, but it was a tough read. Unlike what the title might suggest this book is a collection of short stories. Some, but not all, of them are structured like interviews. Some, but not all, focus on a male character. Some, but not all, are about awful people.
The vibe of the book is that it is a meditation on thinking.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Lolita</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/lolita/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 13:49:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/lolita/</guid><description>Notes on what I learnt on May 19, 2021.</description></item></channel></rss>
