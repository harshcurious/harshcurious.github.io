My rating: 5 of 5 stars
I enjoyed it, but it was a tough read. Unlike what the title might suggest this book is a collection of short stories. Some, but not all, of them are structured like interviews. Some, but not all, focus on a male character. Some, but not all, are about awful people.
The vibe of the book is that it is a meditation on thinking.</description></item></channel></rss>
