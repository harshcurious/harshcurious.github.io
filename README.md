# My website at [harshcurious.com](https://harshcurious.github.io/)
Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the theme being [Paper-Mod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/)

Directory structure for Content files:
```
.
├── archetypes
├── config.toml
├── content
├── data
├── layouts
├── static
└── themes
```
I then run the `hugo --minfy` command with `publishDir: ./`. So everything else is the website content. I know it is not the ideal way but it works for now.
