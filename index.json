[{"content":"Recently I was reading a beautiful interview of Amartya Sen done by The Harvard Gazette. You can read my higlights over at hypothes.is This reminded me of the first time I read a paper by Amartya Sen.\nBack when I was in the ninth grade I was required to do a project for my Social Studies class. The topic allotted to me was \u0026ldquo;Should we have caste based reservation?\u0026rdquo; Heavy stuff 😩, especially for my 14-year-old ass.1\nI did what every, I felt I needed to do. Read economics papers2 on caste-based economic inequality. Of those the most challenging one was a paper by Amartya Sen. (I tried to look it up, but I can\u0026rsquo;t find it anymore. From what I remember it was on social inequality and its economic consequences.) Athough I remember very little of the paper, it had a profound impact on me as a human being. In modern terminology it would probably be called intersectional social justice or something like that. I am not an expert.\nReading all the evidence I did, I came to the obvious conclusion that there is a genuine caste-based economic and social disparity. The caste based reservations don\u0026rsquo;t lead to much social progression for the SC and ST communities, but it does help some individuals from those communities to gain more social acceptance and economic. That\u0026rsquo;s something better than nothing. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, these reservations have lead to massive intra-caste inequalities within these castes. But that\u0026rsquo;s the story of modern capitalism. Capital begets capital in the modern world. Labour begets little if anything.\nBack to my story. I submitted an early version of my project to my school teacher. The only suggestion he made was correcting a few typos I had. But I could see it in his eyes that this was not the conclusion he agreed with. Eventually, I got a B for the project. Because I stuck with my guns. I had read at least 5 papers. I had read some NSSO (National Sample Survey Organisation) data. After this incident, I decided never to study anything related to humanities and social sciences. I felt that the quality didn\u0026rsquo;t matter in these fields, only conclusions did. Math was so much better. If you can prove something it\u0026rsquo;s true, if you can disprove something it\u0026rsquo;s false. Some random person is not going to decide based on whatever random criteria they came up with.\nFor context, I used to read most of my social studies books in the summer break before the academic year started. I came third at the all-India level of the INCA National Map Quiz right about then. These tiny things matter so much to a young student. It\u0026rsquo;s frightening how deep our influences go. How many trivial actions lead to where we are at!\n  This was the time of discussion of creamy layer. The whole gujjar protest to be included into the OBCs was coming soon. The upper-cast Hindus were starting to align against caset-bsed reservation.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I found one of the papers I read. It\u0026rsquo;s this(link to pdf) one on The Effectiveness of Jobs Reservation. I did not understand the math in this paper so largely ignored the numbers this paper. I did not understand anything beyond mean, mode, and median in statistic at this point of time.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://harshcurious.com/posts/social-sciences-hate/","summary":"Recently I was reading a beautiful interview of Amartya Sen done by The Harvard Gazette.

Unlike what the title might suggest this book is a collection of short stories. Some, but not all, of them are structured like interviews. Some, but not all, focus on a male character. Some, but not all, are about awful people.\nThe vibe of the book is that it is a meditation on thinking. An extremely cynical meditation, but a meditation none the less. You could say it is a meditation on how useful it actually is to think. Almost all of the stories draw a contrast between a very thought out idea, and the very base (or trite or simple) version of the same. The suggestion being how similar they are. He manages to bring this out consistently, and often hilariously. My favorite of the bunch was the penultimate short story. It talks about love in very difficult circumstances. Has a lot of twists and turns. And is just really thought provoking. Another one I really likes is the story called Signifying Nothing. Just a hilarious of how we deal with our problems in real life. The Depressed Person is another impressive story about how thinking about a problem does not lead to a solution. There are also a lot of footnotes in this one, going waaaay meta. Speaking of meta, we have the Octet. Here the narrator is dealing with the problem of writing a cohesive collection of short stories.\nThat is the biggest problem with the book. It is sometimes, too meta for its own good. Sometimes it is hard to see where the story is going and if it is worthwhile to waste your brain cell to decipher what David Foster Wallace is trying to say. But it always leads you to an alleyway that you have never explored before. If you are willing to work through a book, and I mean work through it, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, might I suggest the Witcher series. It is a more fun, more sincere book that also has a lot of philosophy peppered in.\nAt the end I will just add that much like Consider the Lobster this book is going to remain with me a long while. I might even reread it at some point. After all, there are a number of stories in this book that I have no clue about (I am talking about you the last story 🥺). \r","permalink":"https://harshcurious.com/posts/briefinterviewhideous/","summary":"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men by David Foster Wallace\rMy rating: 5 of 5 stars\nI enjoyed it, but it was a tough read.

They were utterly boring, but defended resolutely. Weird formation; three man back line; Saka and Tierney as wingbacks; defensive midfield of Partey and Elneny. Got a very lucky goal. Chelsea have been on an amazing run lately.  Lolita  Reading the book, I am utterly horrified most of the time. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand how people see beauty in it. Lolita seems like she is utterly depressed. There is a conflation of possession and love here. This is something I have been thinking about for a long time, but this recent article from Annie Zaidi has brought it to the fore.    Let me now talk about the only love I know about, which is familial love.  The way I would think about my relationship with my parents is the sense of mutual responsibility. There is barely any honest communication. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell them if something good or bad happens to me. And I am sure they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t either to save me from extreme emotions. I am coddled to the point where I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I belong in the home grew up in. My aim growing up had a lot to do with autonomy, I just wanted to feel more like me. As things have gone so far, I am further away from it then where I started from.   And what about the traditional Indian1 Guru-shishya, teacher-student, relationship. The shishya is expected to give up complete control to their loving Guru. The Guru can beat them, make the shishya do their chores, ask for ridiculous things2 as gifts, and even fu_king rape them3. It\u0026rsquo;s all ok. It\u0026rsquo;s all out of love for their students. Another manifestation of this conflation of control and love can be seen with the relationship that a lot of Indians have with their dogs. When I walked around in the evening/morning I would encounter a lot of people walking their dogs🐕. That\u0026rsquo;s fairly normal. What\u0026rsquo;s weird is that they often carry sticks (made of heavy wood or metal). I have always wondered what kind of a relationship these people have with their pets! I am sure if I ask them about it they will say that they like their dogs, maybe even love them. Who knows 😕. But does their dog love them. It is dependent on them. It is afraid of them. Maybe he won\u0026rsquo;t run even if they let it off the leash. But does their dog love them or is it just really afraid of them that it would do anything to make it seem like it loves them. What I am trying to get at is that love is only truly perceptible when there is a fundamental equality between individuals. When everyone is genuinely allowed to be themselves. They are allowed to be honest. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong this equality is impossible to judge from the outside. I am definitely not promoting the idea of love only possible between people in the same economic class. Economic status is just one part of the equation. Not the whole. This idea of equality is difficult to grapple with. There is no uniform formula applicable to everyone. Let\u0026rsquo;s take the case of a housewife for example. In some cases, this economic power imbalance might prevent a wife from getting out of an abusive relationship. At time another person might have this exact expectation out of their relationship and enjoy the housework. They might still feel a sense of equality in the relationship. It is for the individual to figure out among themselves. It\u0026rsquo;s a feeling, not a fact or figure.    From what I have read, and I am not well informed on this topic. This is certainly not a nuancesed take on the topic. It\u0026rsquo;s absolutely not intended for a western audience unaware of the Indian context.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Drona asks Ekalavya to cut off his right thumb as Guru Dakshina, a gift.

Alternative to a Turing Machine.\n  Until the 1960s, the lambda calculus was only a formalism. Since Richard Montague and other linguists' applied it in understanding the semantics of natural language, the lambda calculus has gained popularity in both linguistics, and computer science.\n  Computable functions2 are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The lambda calculus provides a simple semantics for computation, enabling properties of computation to be studied formally.\n  Lambda calculus simplifies the semantics in two ways:\n  Lambda calculus treats functions “anonymously”, without giving them explicit names. For example:\n square_sum$(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$\n can be turned anonymous form by rewriting it as\n $(x,y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2$\n You now think of it as a mapping of the tuple $x$, and $y$ to $x^2+y^2$.\n  Lambda calculus only uses functions of a single input. For instance, the square_sum function is equivalent to the functions\n $x \\mapsto (y \\mapsto x^2+ y^2)$\n This method is known as currying. It transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.\nWe understand this approach to functions by calculating square_sum at $(5,2)$.\n $((x,y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2)(5,2)$ $= 5^2 +2^2$ $=29$\n On the other hand, the curried version requires an additional step.\n $\\left( \\left( x \\mapsto (y \\mapsto x^2 + y^2) \\right)(5) \\right)(2)$ $= (y \\mapsto 5^2 + y^2)(2)$ $= 5^2 + 2^2$ $= 29$\n     The lambda calculus consists of a language of lambda terms, which is defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules, which allow manipulation of the lambda terms.\n  Lambda terms: The following three rules provide an inductive definition.\n A variable, $x$, is itself a valid lambda term. If $t$ is a lambda term, and $x$ is a variable, then $( \\lambda x, t )$ is a lambda term (called an abstraction). If $t$ and $s$ are lambda terms, then $(ts)$ is a lambda term (called an application). Nothing else is a lambda term. Thus, a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules.    I will look at the mathematical background in detail at some other time. Let\u0026rsquo;s move on to Python.\n  Understanding Lambda Functions in Python Let\u0026rsquo;s consider the following simple code:\nlambda x: x + 1 It can be divided in the following three parts:\n The keyword: lambda; indicates that a lambda function is being used. A bound variable: x; refers to the variable to which we are applying the lambda function. A body: x+1; indicates what the lambda function does to the bounded variable.

There I found the following statement:\n For the build tools to produce an executable, the function main must be declared, and it becomes the entry point for the program. Function main is located in a package called main. If your main function doesn’t exist in package main, the build tools won’t produce an executable. Packages define a unit of compiled code and their names help provide a level of indirection to the identifiers that are declared inside them, just like a namespace. This makes it possible to distinguish identifiers that are declared with exactly the same name in the different packages you import.    I am not sure if I understand the idea of packages in Go yet. What I think is happening is that the first line of a .go file declares its place in overall structure of the code.\n  Looking at chapter 3 of Go In Action, I find the following:\n All Go programs are organized into groups of files called packages. This is done so that code can be included in other projects as smaller reusable pieces. All .go files must declare the package that they belong to as the first line of the file excluding whitespace and comments. Packages are contained in a single directory. You may not have multiple packages in the same directory, nor may you split a package across multiple directories. This means that all .go files in a single directory must declare the same package name. The package name main designates to the Go command that this package is intended to be compiled into a binary executable. All of the executable programs you build in Go must have a package called main.    Run Go Programs  You can run a .go file by the command go run simplest-go-program.go. This will compile your .go file and return any syntax errors encountered. The go run command is not the recommended way to compile large Go projects. For larger Go projects you need to run the go build or the go install commands. Go project supporting Go modules needs a go.mod file located in the root folder of that project. The go.mod file can be generated by the go mod init subcommand.  Some go Subcommands  go vet: checks code for possible logical errors. go fmt: formats Go source code with a consistent coding style. go test: runs tests and benchmarks. go doc: opens Go documentation in terminal windows. go mod init example.com/myproject: generates a go.modfile in the current directory. This turns the current directory into the root directory of a module called example.com/myproject. go mod tidy: adds missing module dependencies into and removes unused module dependencies from the go.mod file by analyzing all the source code of the current project.

There is a second compiler gccgo, but it is no longer a priority for the Go design team.\n  Go Toolchain is a set of tools for Go development maintained by Go team. gc is a part of this collection.\n  The version of Go is consistent with the version of Go Toolchain. There were/are two major versions released each year.\n  Go 1.8 made massive improvements in the concurrent garbage collection implementation. Lags caused by garbage collection were massively reduced.\n  Go is popular for development in\n networks system tools databases block chain    There are signs of usage in\n game development big data AI    Drawbacks\n Go doesn\u0026rsquo;t support arbitrary immutable values. Right now many values which are not supposed to be modified in standard packages are declared as variables. This is a security concern. Go also doesn\u0026rsquo;t support generics for custom types and functions. (I don\u0026rsquo;t understand this one.)    The Go Toolchain  In order to easily call the go command add the bin sub-folder to the PATH environment variable. Since Go 1.16, project dependencies are managed using modules. GOPATH is an environment variable. The default Go workflow happens entirely inside the GOPATH. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s the go folder under the home directory of the current user. It has three folders in there.  bin: the place where Go program binaries end up. pkg: stores the cached versions of Go modules for local Go projects. src: the place where you should store your projects.   The simplest Go program: package main func main() { }  The first line package main specifies the package name.      Apparently there is an old cartoon called Go Go Gopher.

Spaced repetition in Mathematics  I recently started using Anki again. With MathJax support it finally seems worth the effort. But I am still not sure about how to write my cards. To remedy that I am reading a number of articles on using Anki. I really like this take on spaced repetition. I think that my memory is weak. And there is a definite possibility that improving it can make me a better mathematician. The Ankification process 😘 of understanding math.  **Understanding the proof : Requires multiple passes over the proof.  Start by picking out single elements of the proof and converting them to Anki cards. Then restate the idea in multiple ways. One way to do this is by simplifying both questions and answers. Move to all the different ideas in the proof. Stay on an idea until it feels like it\u0026rsquo;s yours. You should feel comfortable in these spaces. That means understanding it in as many ways as possible and making as many connections as possible.1 The problem with this step is that it is undirected, and you never know when to stop. Have the following aim in mind: How do I describe the proof in one line. You should have enough chunks to prove the statement in one line. Think of this as the boundary condition for proof-learning optimization. Make both questions and answers as atomic as possible. This process can feel very wasteful, but over time this completely changes the understanding of the proof. In fact some older cards may start to seem bad and should be replaced by newer better ones. This is a long-term process; wait for it to run its course.   Variations, pushing the boundaries: One way of deepening your understanding further is to find ways of pushing the boundaries of the proof and of the theorem. Ask yourself a few questions.  Is every hypothesis necessary? What if I remove one? What if I change one? Why not? Can you get more out of the proof? Can you take the argument further? Try to apply it elsewhere! This phase really is open ended!        Proofs are an interconnected network of simple observations.

Javascript : Logic that your browser can execute.  To use css just pick a block element in the HTML (the selector) and put certain styling information under it (the properties). Eg:\nul { margin: 0; padding: 0; } Here ul is a selector which target the unordered list elements. In this particular case it changes the margin, and padding amount.\nYou can also target an HTML tag by the parent tag around it , i.e. compound selectors. For example to target an unordered list inside the nav tags, you can do the following:\nnav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; } In this case the nav tag does not need to be the immediate parent. There can be other tags/layers between them.\nYou query for a class with a dot. Eg:\n.article-title { font-size: 2rem; } You can combine these two. Eg:\narticle.content{ font-size: 2rem; This looks for a class content inside an article tag. A given tag can have multiple classes. These classes are delineated by a space. Eg: \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026quot;css-selector\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;content body-head\u0026quot;\u0026gt; Pick a Heading \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\nYou use a # to target an id. Eg, to target the prior \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; tag we can write the following:\n#css-selector { width: 150%; } An id selector has higher priority to a class selector. It is more specific. Similarly h1.content is more specific than .content. This can be very tricky in CSS. Classes are more specific than just tags. For the same tag, the css mentioned at the bottom has higher priority than the one above it.\nLearning to Type I have decided to finally start learning how to type quickly using the 10 finger method.

The much speculated A15 bionic might be Armv9 chip.  From the horse\u0026rsquo;s mouth  Expects 100% of shared data to be processed on ARM (that includes the server space). Security:  Armv9 introduces the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA). This protects portion of code and data from read or write while-in-use at the hardware level. Realms: Dynamically created regions that are separated from everything else while it is in-use, at rest, and in transit. Can be created by any application.   AI :  SVE (in partnership with Fujitsu) SVE2 enables better machine learning (ML) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) capabilities. Improves  5G processing VR and AR Local ML processing like image processing and smart home applications Future aim to improve matrix multiplication within the CPU. AI innovations in Mali GPU and Ethos NPU.     Expect performance increase of over 30% across the next two generations. Total compute design will improve specialized performance. Working on increasing frequency, bandwidth, and cache-size, and reducing memory latency. TODO : Want to read Total SoC Compute for Dummies, available at ARM website. TODO : There is more about SVE here.  From xda-developers  First major revision since October 2011 when v8 was launched. There have been some revisions since. Major additions:  SVE2 Realm Management Extension (RME) BRBE Embedded Trace Extension (ETE) and Trace Buffer Extension (TRBE) TME   Anandtech article has been referenced for everything so let me move there.  From Anandtech  The arm versioning is about Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Announced as part of the Arm\u0026rsquo;s Vision Day event. v9 is not as big of a jump as v8 was. In v8 AArch64 was introduced, which was a new instruction set and execution mode. AArch64 is still the basis of V9. SVE2 is now replacing NEON. SVE based on NEON was used in Fujitsu\u0026rsquo;s A64FX CPU core. Focused on high performance computing (HPC) applications. SVE2 also includes variable vector size. Also software to scale easily between IoT devices and future high powered cores.  Breaking the Cycle of Overthinking  Hyper-vigilant : Really aware of the surroundings.

Added support for MathJax and Plotpy on this website The mathjax support  Followed the instruction from https://geoffruddock.com/math-typesetting-in-hugo/ with minor additions.   Create a file called mathjax_support.html in the folder ./layout/partials with the following content:  \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; MathJax = { tex: { inlineMath: [[\u0026#39;$\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;$\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;\\\\(\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\\\\)\u0026#39;]], displayMath: [[\u0026#39;$$\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;$$\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;\\\\[\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\\\\]\u0026#39;]], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true }, options: { skipHtmlTags: [\u0026#39;script\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noscript\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;style\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;textarea\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;pre\u0026#39;] } }; window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, (event) =\u0026gt; { document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#34;mjx-container\u0026#34;).forEach(function(x){ x.parentElement.classList += \u0026#39;has-jax\u0026#39;}) }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;MathJax-script\u0026#34; async src=\u0026#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; I would not recommend creating it inside the theme folder, if you are ever planning on updating your theme.\nNext if your theme has header-extend.html use that, if not then use the header.html file. It should be in the ./themes/THEME_NAME/layouts/partials. Copy this file to your root directory keeping the same directory structure. So in my case my new file will be ./layouts/partials/header-extend.html To this I add  {{ if .Params.mathjax }} {{ partial \u0026#34;mathjax_support.html\u0026#34; . }} {{ end }} If you are using the head file, ensure that this is added before the closing \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; tag. 3. Now if you have the statement mathjax: true in the front matter of your markdown file, then you can use mathjax on your website. 4. (Optional) To your archetype file, add the mathjax: true Front Matter. 5. (Optional) To your css file add:\ncode.has-jax { -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; background: inherit !important; border: none !important; font-size: 100%; } Plotly  Used for creating interactive diagrams. Export your plot as a json file using the write_image library as follows:  from plotly.io import write_image #...

But it didn\u0026rsquo;t have native MathJax support back then. Was overwhelmed the last time around. No app on the home screen. Won\u0026rsquo;t worry about the counter TODO: Add the python commands over there. Added MiKelTeX to the environment, by searching for the term environment variable in the start menu. That made LateX on Anki work for me.

The daily cases yesterday were over 50000 for the first time since November. There are reported cases of multiple new variants (in a situation were DNA sequencing is extremely rare).\nThe situation is frightening, especially some of the new variants being able to evade the immune system much more efficiently. I have been wearing a mask in public spaces at all times, but nobody else seems to be interested in doing so. Still the vast majority of people I encounter on my daily walk don\u0026rsquo;t wear a mask.\nBullshitting the bullshitter  From the horse\u0026rsquo;s mouth: talk with Shane Littrell on the Guardian science podcast. The research paper: ‘You can’t bullshit a bullshitter’ (or can you?):Bullshitting frequency predicts receptivity to various types of misleading information. Open access 🔓 From the abstract:  Research into both receptivity to falling for bullshit and the propensity to produce it. Truism: You can\u0026rsquo;t bullshit a bullshitter. But is it true? Both bullshit receptivity and bullshitting frequency are negatively related to cognitive ability and aspects of analytic thinking style (Littrell, Risko, \u0026amp; Fugelsang, 2021; Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler, \u0026amp;Fugelsang, 2015). However, separate research suggests that individuals who frequently engage in deception are better at detecting it  people who self-report engaging more frequent ly in lying (i.e., deliberately convincing someone of a falsehood)also self-report being signiﬁcantly better than average at detecting lies from others (Zvi \u0026amp;Elaad, 2018). those who produce more convincing lies are also actually better at detecting lies (W right, Berry, \u0026amp; Bird, 2012, 2013) other more recent studies suggest this may not be the case (Hudson, Vrij,Akehurst, Hope, \u0026amp; Satchell, 2020).   Found that frequency of persuasive bullshitting (i.e., bullshitting intended to impress or persuade others) positively predicts susceptibility to various types of misleading information and that this association is robust to individual differences in cognitive ability and analytic cognitive style. N=826; across three studies.   Recent research has suggested that bullshitting and lying, while clearly related, are psychologically distinguishable constructs (Littrell, Risko, et al., 2021). Liars show a stronger negative association with self-regard and a stronger positive association with lie acceptability than bullshitters (Littrell, Risko, et al., 2021). Persuasive bullshitting (i.e., bullshitting motivated by a desire to impress or persuade others) has been found to be signiﬁcantly, negatively related to cognitive ability while it\u0026rsquo;s not the case with lying (Littrell, Risko, et al., 2021; Michels, Molz, \u0026amp; Maas genannt Bermpohl, 2020). Bullshit: information designed to impress, persuade, and/or otherwise mislead that is often constructed with an indifference for the truth. Bullshit can range from coherent yet hyperbolic (any article headline from Atlantic) or suspiciously implausible (almost all conspiracy theories), to jargon-heavy yet obscure or non-sensible (a-la Deepak Chopra), to technically accurate yet misleadingly irrelevant (a lot of climate deniers; gun right advocates; mann-ki-baat). Bullshitting is intentional. The extent to which a person intentionally spreads bullshit (i.e.,engages in bullshitting) in everyday situations can be estimated using the Bullshitting Frequency Scale (BSF; Littrell, Risko, et al., 2021). BSF measures self-reported frequency with which people bullshit to:  impress, persuade, or ﬁt in with others (persuasive bullshitting) be evasive (evasive bullshitting) for example politicians.   Persuasive bullshitting frequency is positively related to \u0026lsquo;bullshitting behavior\u0026rsquo; like claiming expertise in non-existent topics (Jerrim et al., 2019) and negatively related to intelligence and some aspects of analytical thinking. Basically evasive bullshitting is useful like lying to a partner about an awful haircut. It can definitely be useful in forming coalition. Eg: recent Sharad Pawar comments. I am more interested in bullshit receptivity. I kinda appreciate the ability to bullshit. I have a tough time doing that. I am a lot straightforward. It is socially useful to fit in, especially the evasive kind. Bullshit receptivity: the ease with which someone fall for bullshit. Bullshit receptivity scale (Pennycook et al. 2015):  Setup for VSCodium  I had an installation for VSCodium in my machine, but I hadn\u0026rsquo;t used it ever. I decided to use it. Took a while to set it up. Primarily, there are a few issues with using codium instead of code.   I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to install some of the extension I wanted. They weren\u0026rsquo;t available on the default extension store. Apparently codium uses open-vsx.org as extension gallery. So only the extensions registered there are available on codium. There is a workaround to use the VS Code Marketplace, but it may not be legal. From the VSCodium Doc: Create a custom product.json at %USER%\\AppData\\Roaming\\VSCodium with the following content:\n{ \u0026#34;extensionsGallery\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;serviceUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cacheUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://vscode.blob.core.windows.net/gallery/index\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;itemUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;controlUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recommendationsUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Use this at your own risk.\n  Another important aspect is the propriety debugging tools for C#/C++. This was especially concerning for me because I plan on using PlatfomIO IDE for Raspberry Pi Pico. And PlatformIO is built on the C++ extension. For now I have used the vsix installation for these two.\n  I have still not managed to get the git Oauth working on codium. I just keeps failing to login. Update 27th Match: Finally managed to fix it. Here is what I did.\n Just click on the login option on codium. It should open a link in the browser which would look something like this:  https://vscode-auth.github.com/authorize/?callbackUri=vscodium://vscode.github-authentication/did-authenticate%253FwindowId%253D1\u0026amp;scope=read:user%20repo%20user:email\u0026amp;state=16b13b86-dbca-4b0d-ac5e-d5c1def0f748\u0026amp;responseType=code\u0026amp;authServer=https://github.com\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t click on the continue button.  Instead edit the url just after callbackUri= from vscodium to vscode. So the new link should be:  https://vscode-auth.github.com/authorize/?callbackUri=vscode://vscode.github-authentication/did-authenticate%253FwindowId%253D1\u0026amp;scope=read:user%20repo%20user:email\u0026amp;state=16b13b86-dbca-4b0d-ac5e-d5c1def0f748\u0026amp;responseType=code\u0026amp;authServer=https://github.com\n  Now you are ready. Click on the continue button. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t get an error. Instead you will get to the authorization page. Fill your details. Once you have authorized the extension, you should get to a page which gives you a token and a open in app link. The open in app link will not work. Instead copy the token. Go back to the codium window. At the bottom, in the status bar, you will see a github.com button. Click it. The command running utility opens. In it paste your token and press enter. If you press Esc, you will have to restart the authentication process. This worked for me, your milage may vary.    I have added a bunch of extensions. I am syncing them using my github account via gists. There is an extension called Settings Sync. It can sync your settings using a secret gist.\n    Watched a fair bit of the cricket match 🏏 I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is happening. Sometimes I think the sheer number of good players in the Indian team is too much and sometimes I feel like England has a more well rounded team than India. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if both can be true at the same time. England crushed India in a more difficult run chase than the 1st ODI. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to think anymore. I was utterly surprized at how India won the the t20 series and the first ODI. Maybe it was a fluke. I have to look at some kind of data. The matches so far in the limited over games have been fun but confusing.\n","permalink":"https://harshcurious.com/posts/til1/","summary":"The second wave of coronavirus is here in India I read this article from indian express in the morning.

Let\u0026rsquo;s carry on and celebrate with a few 📷 .\nNow that I have calmed down a little bit, let me look at the mysterious bit of code. From what\u0026rsquo;s happening I know that the code switches the leds in the 7-segment display so that we loop through 0 to 9 and A to F and then 0 again. The display changes every 0.5 seconds.\nTime for google 🔍 . Found it 🙌. Let me rewrite the explanation in my own way.\nWhat Was that Code The parts that I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand were 0x3f-like objects and the operation \u0026lt;\u0026lt;.\nLet me first understand 0x3f. Upon googling I found this on the wikipedia page of 7-segment display. This is the hexadecimal code for 0b00111111 binary code.\n   Display Hex binary     0 0x3f 0b 00111111   1 0x06 0b 00000110   2 0x5b 0b 01011011   3 0x4f 0b 01001111   4 0x66 0b 01100110   5 0x6d 0b 01101101   6 0x7d 0b 01111101   7 0x07 0b 00000111   8 0x7f 0b 01111111   9 0x6f 0b 01101111   A 0x77 0b 01110111   b 0x7c 0b 01111100   C 0x39 0b 00111001   d 0x5e 0b 01011110   E 0x79 0b 01111001   F 0x71 0b 01110001   . 0x80 0b 10000000    When I look at the python documentation x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; y is a bitwise operation. And what it does is it returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y units (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). At the same link I saw that x \u0026amp; y is the bitwise and. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s 0. Let me look at a few examples.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0x01) \u0026#39;0b1\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0x01 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 0) \u0026#39;0b1\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0x01 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 1) \u0026#39;0b10\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0x01 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 2) \u0026#39;0b100\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0x06) \u0026#39;0b110\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0x06 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 3) \u0026#39;0b110000\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0b00111111 \u0026amp; 0b00000001) \u0026#39;0b1\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0b00111111 \u0026amp; 0b00010001) \u0026#39;0b10001\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; bin(0b10111111 \u0026amp; 0b10010001) \u0026#39;0b10010001\u0026#39; I think this makes these operations clear to me. In case of x\u0026lt;\u0026lt;y you add y number of zeros to the binary form of x. x \u0026amp; y looks at the binary form of x and y and performs the and operation on every bit. In case this isn\u0026rsquo;t clear yet let me write the case of 0b00111111 \u0026amp; 0b00000001 again:\n0b00111111 0b00000001 || 0b00000001 # which is the same as 0b1 To understand what is happening I have to look at the circuit I have made. I notice that pin 11 (using the raspberry pi board convention) is connected to the pin ?? on the 7-segment display.

Learn  concurrency model fast compiler syntax type system concurrency channels testing, etc    How Modern programming challenges Go away  Currently choice between  rapid development : Ruby, python fast execution : C, C++.   Go offers both simultaneously. Also, concise syntax : few keywords Compiler : less build time. Built-in concurrency: no special threading libraries. Type system: less overhead; more reusability  How is the compiler Go-ing?  Quick compiles by  smart compiling simplified dependency resolution algorithm only looks at the libraries directly used not all dependencies of all libraries included in the dependency chain.       Dynamic languages Static languages     Types checked on the fly, during execution Types checked before run-time   Less verbose Better code completion   Easier to make change; no wait for recompilation Allows compiler optimization   Less More searchable   Difficult to work with other type based systems Easier to work with other systems (that rely on ststic type) like relational databases   Fewer syntax and semantic errors Easier to catch type errors   Eg: Perl, Python, JS C, C++, Java, Go, Rust     Go is a static language  compiler catches type differences easier to catch type errors    Concurrency  Difficult to be efficient in hardware utilization Others need thread synchronization code, prone to errors Strongest feature Gorutines  like threads, use less memory and code   Channels  data structue lets you send typed messages between goroutines syncronization built-in   Model where you  send data between goroutines goroutines don\u0026rsquo;t fight for same data.    goroutines  functions that run simultaneously Many goroutines can run on a single thread For example, a web server that can handle multiple web requsts.  In Go, the net/http library has concurrency built-in using goroutines. In C/Java, need extra code to use threading   Use less memory than threads. Go runtime automatically schedules execution of goroutines  An example of goroutine:\nfunc log(msg string){ ... some logging code here } // Elsewhere in our code after we\u0026#39;ve discovered an error. go log(\u0026#34;something dire happened\u0026#34;) Here the keyword go runs the log function as a goroutine. You can execute the rest of the program while the logging happened.\n No overhead so there can be thousands of them.  Channels  Data structure that enable safe data communication between goroutines. Hardest aspect of concurrency: data isn\u0026rsquo;t unexpectedly modified by concurrently running threads, processes, or goroutines. Other languages make it hard to have syncronized changes. Channels ensure only one goroutine modifies data at any time. Exchange of data between goroutines is synchronized and both goroutines know that the exchange took place. Channels don\u0026rsquo;t provide data access protection between goroutines.  If copies are exchanged through a channel, then it\u0026rsquo;s fine. If pointers to the data are exchanged, then each goroutine needs to be syncronized if different goroutines are performing read/write actions.    Type System ####There are three layers here:\n To define a new type, all you need to do is use existing types and add new methods. This is type composition. But these new methods, in terms of application, are no different from the inherited methods. This is called duck typing. \u0026ldquo;If it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck\u0026rdquo; (for all intent and purposes). The link that makes it click for me is this link. Essentially the idea is you can call len() on any Python object that defines a .__len__() method. So you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know if the object is str, list, dict, or a userdefined one, (or through inheretence in go). You model behaviour not model type. You don\u0026rsquo;t declare you are implementing an interface. Compiler does the work of checking if your type satify the interface you are using. This the simple interface feature in Go.  ErGo Memory Management  Has modern garbage collector. Don\u0026rsquo;t need to allocate and free memory like C or C++. Using this with threading and heavy concurrency is tedious. Go does this for you.  Worst part of the book Avoids teaching you how to code on your device. How can you tell me to code entirely online.

What\u0026rsquo;s an object?   Strings are objects\n  Object contains two things\n data methods : functions built into objects and available to any instance    The dir shows avilable methods associated with the object   Methods have a different syntax:   Some string methods :   str.upper() : as shown above, return copy by turning all characters into uppercase.\n  str.capitalize() : returns copy with first character capitalized and the rest lowercased\n  str.casefold : removes all case distictions; umlauts, etc removed\n  str.count(sub[, start[, end]]) : Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range $[start, end]$\n  str.find(sub[, start[, end]]) : Returns the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice $s[start:end]$. Returns -1 if sub is not found.\n  in operator (not a method):\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Py\u0026#39; in \u0026#39;Python\u0026#39; True   str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]]) : Returns True if the string ends with the specified suffix, otherwise return False. suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for.\n  str.format(*args, **kwargs) : replaces elements in {} with a string value. Eg\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026#34;The sum of 1 + 2 is {0}\u0026#34;.format(1+2) \u0026#39;The sum of 1 + 2 is 3\u0026#39; This is a relatively new inclusion to Python. More details later.\n  str.index(sub[, start[, end]]) : like find(), but returns ValueError when substring is not found.\n  str.isdigit() : returns True if all characters are digits and at least one character, False otherwise. Digits include decimals and special ones (like non-base 10 and superscript ones).\n  str.join(iterable) : Returns a string which is a concatenation of strings in iterable. Error TypeError if there is a non-string value in iterable.\n  str.partition(sep) : Splits the string at the first occurence of sep and returns a 3-tuple containing the part before separator, the seperator, and the part after separator.\n  str.replace(old,new[,count]) : Returns a copy of str with all occurances of old replaced by new. If count is provided then only the first count-number of replacements are held.\n  str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1) : Returns a list of words in the string, all of which are separated by sep. The defaults separates whitespace characters.\n  str.startswith : Like endswith(), but checks for prefix.\n  str.strip([chars]) : Returns a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.

I have used the popular static site generator Hugo. Hugo is based on the language go. Disclaimer: this is the second time I am creating my website using Hugo. But the last time I created this was in 2015, so a lot has changed.\nInstalling Hugo on Windows 10 My recommendation is to use Chocolatey to install Hugo although there are binaries available at github for direct installation. If Chocolatey is installed on your system, open powershell by right clicking the start button. There type\nchococ install hugo\rto install Hugo. Now are ready to use Hugo commands from the powershell. To check if the installtion went well type hugo version. It will display the current version of Hugo.\nUsing Hugo One way to quickly learn how to use Hugo is to follow the quickstart guide over at the Hugo website. There is one problem, with the echo command, I encountered while applying it on Windows 10. For completeness I will describe all the steps involved.\nWe begin by creating a directory with the necessary structure for our website. I stated by creating a practice folder called quickstart using\nhugo new site quickstart\rThen type\ncd quickstart\rto move into the newly created directory.\nNext we add a theme to our website. We will add the Ananke theme using git.\ngit init\rgit submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke\rMore themes are available at themes.hugo.io. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have git installed you can also download the themes from there, and extract the compressed folder into the themes folder in your site\u0026rsquo;s directory. Using git is higly recommended.\nTake a look in the themes folder in your site\u0026rsquo;s directory. There should be a folder named ananke inside. Go back to the quickstart directory and open the config.toml file in your faourite text editor. I am using Atom. Add\ntheme = \u0026quot;ananke\u0026quot;\rto the end of your config file.\nNow your website is essentially ready. Let\u0026rsquo;s add our first post. Type the following command on the powershell\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md\rThis will create a markdownfile named my-first-post.md in the content\u0026gt;posts. Open it in a text editor. You will notice that the file already contains the following:\n---\rtitle: \u0026quot;My First Post\u0026quot;\rdate: 2021-02-27T16:42:29+05:30\rdraft: true\r---\rThe title is going to be the title of your blog post, date is the time when your file was created, and \u0026lsquo;draft\u0026rsquo; represents whether or no your post is published. Change draft to false when you are happy with the content.\nEven when draft is set to true, you can see how it will look on you website by typing the folloing in the powershell.\nhugo server -D\rimage\nClick on the link displayed to see the current status of your website. Make your changes. Once you are happy with your changes, build your site by typing the following in your powershell\nhugo\rYour website is published in the public folder in your website directory.\nCreating your Website ","permalink":"https://harshcurious.com/posts/hugocreation/","summary":"This post describes the creation process of this website.

This makes it really hard to add it to your PATH in the Powershell. Chocolatey on the other hand, handles it all for you and you can start using Julia by typing julia on the Powershell prompt. Also, updating Julia will be way easier, just run the command choco upgrade julia --confirm.\nSetting Up Atom to use as my markdown editor I have borrowed a lot of what I am sharing from these two wonderful resources 1 and 2.\nInstall (using the installer at Atom.io) and open Atom. Close all the welcome messages (after reading them if you feel like it). Click File \u0026raquo; Settings. Now go to the install option and search and install the following packages\n markdown-writer : improves the markdown editing process especially for static blogs markdown-preview-plus : provides real-time preview of markdown with LaTeX support language-markdown : Adds grammar support for Markdown, and smart context-aware behavior to lists autosave : protects your work by saving it periodically highlightselected : highlights occurance of the selected word linter-retextjs : gives feedback on your writing pandoc-convert : if you want to directly convert your markdown file into HTML auto-terminal-powershell : open powershell terminal in the current file\u0026rsquo;s directory wordcount : if you want to see the wordcount of your document  If you have never written in markdown before, this is an excellent resourse. I am using this markdownguide page as my reference for markdown syntax.\nInstalling Franklin First type julia in the powershell to get to the Julia prompt julia\u0026gt;. Them press ] to get to pkg, julia\u0026rsquo;s package manager. You prompt will change to (@v1.5) pkg\u0026gt;. Now type\nadd Franklin and Franklin package will be installed. Once this package is intalled, (optionally) install the NodeJS package\nadd NodeJS Now the nest commands on the official website are clearly for linux\nusing NodeJS run(`sudo $(npm_cmd())install highlight.js`) I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to modify it to get it to work for me. This is the point where I gave up. My Node.js is in D directory whereas the julia directory is C. I will have to edit the NodeJS.jl file to make this work. I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna do that right now.
