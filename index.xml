For a long time I wanted to create content like 3Blue1Brown or Math3ma. Short and insightful. Most importantly something brand new. I new way to look at something. Something unique. But I have come to the realization that I am not capable of that. At least not yet.
Also looking at the history of all the creators I admire, they have some terrible stuff under their belt.</description></item><item><title>Mean_variants</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/mean_variants/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 15:04:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/mean_variants/</guid><description>Desc Text.</description></item><item><title>Cleaning conda package cache</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/clean_conda_cache/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 14:27:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/clean_conda_cache/</guid><description>Learning how to clean conda cache.

To ignore Solutions/projects/bin/Debug but not bin/Debug
Solution/*/bin/Debug you can also use the ** wildcard to match any level of subdirectories:

You can read my higlights over at hypothes.is This reminded me of the first time I read a paper by Amartya Sen.
Back when I was in the ninth grade I was required to do a project for my Social Studies class.

My rating: 5 of 5 stars
I enjoyed it, but it was a tough read. Unlike what the title might suggest this book is a collection of short stories. Some, but not all, of them are structured like interviews. Some, but not all, focus on a male character. Some, but not all, are about awful people.
The vibe of the book is that it is a meditation on thinking.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learnt 15</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/til15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021

I have used the popular static site generator Hugo. Hugo is based on the language go. Disclaimer: this is the second time I am creating my website using Hugo. But the last time I created this was in 2015, so a lot has changed.
Installing Hugo on Windows 10 My recommendation is to use Chocolatey to install Hugo although there are binaries available at github for direct installation.</description></item><item><title>FranklinFail</title><link>https://harshcurious.com/posts/franklinfail/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 17:56:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://harshcurious.com/posts/franklinfail/</guid><description>Trying to make Frankin work on Windows 10</description></item></channel></rss>
