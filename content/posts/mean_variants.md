# Mean and It's Variants

## Book Recommendation

I started reading the book Practical Statistics for Data Scientists. I had read the time series portion of it during a work project, and put it on my to read list. I am finally getting around to it and I am really enjoying it so far. If you need like a quick overview of a lot of stats ideas this is great.

If you have seen stat/math like it and want a quick referesher/introduction than great. Otherwise I am not sure if this would be right for you.

## Mean

Obviously, $$ \bar{x} = \dfrac{\sum\_{i=0}{n-1}x_i}{n}$$ where n is the number of elements/datapoints

Every high school student has probably seen this. Remember that it gives very little information about your dataset.
