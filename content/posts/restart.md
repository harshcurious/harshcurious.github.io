I am reframing the goals of this blog.

For a long time I wanted to create content like 3Blue1Brown or Math3ma. Short and insightful. Most importantly something brand new. I new way to look at something. Something unique. But I have come to the realization that I am not capable of that. At least not yet. 

Also looking at the history of all the creators I admire, they have some terrible stuff under their belt. Making mistakes is the only way to get good. Making mistakes publically has always been emotionally challenging for me. But the only way to grow is to take on these kinds of challenges.

So this is going to be a rough ride. Please keep that in mind before referring to the content here.
