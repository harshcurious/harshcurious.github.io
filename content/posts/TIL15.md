## healthygamer.gg Interview with Sasha Grey

{{< youtube id="DMw8G3RPWrQ" title="Dr. K interviews Sasha Grey on Procrastination, Feeling Overwhelmed & more" >}}

### Being a Potential Cult Leader

- People come to Grey with her problems since she was 11.
- Difference between a person who is a therapist and who helps other people with their problems. Training; expertise; limitations.
- If a therapist can't stream on Twitch, then under qualified people will do that job of giving advice. The more qualified you are, the less you are allowed to do the public advice action.
- Sasha says that people approach her for advice because she is experienced, participated in a taboo industry, and manged to change career. They trust her. They trust her advice based on her experience.
- Dr. K : but people came to her for advice when she was 11. Why is the reason they come to her now any different from what it was back then?
- Are you special?
  - If you are humble you can't say yes.
  - Natural charisma.
  - Intentionally hidden aspect of her personality.
  - Real question is can you help someone!
  - Try to give the best advice.
  - IRL helpful person.
  - Why are you able to when others can't? Patient, and a good listener.
  - Able to say what they need to hear without sugar coating anything.
  - Transparent and authentic with people.
- Quite analytical and careful in speech
- Catchprase (more like motto) of SG is *struggle continues*. 
  - Move to another country, and help people.
  - Move to the wilderness. (Cult ðŸ˜Š).
  - Shadow banning from the internet.

### State of Mental Health

- We do a lot of interventions for physical health like trainers, nutritionists, massage therapists, doctors, and surgeons. We need something similar with mental health. That is what healthygamer.gg is about.
- Things like Twitch streamer can augment the mental health sphere.
- Mental health sphere has been monopolized by mental health professionals. Maybe we need to get the help we can get.
- Not possible to have a therapy session on camera. Camera changes people. People start projecting the best version of themselves on camera, even when they are unaware of the change.
- Provide a lot of regurgitated self-help advice.

### Procrastination

- Say armchair psychoanalysis shit like 'you procrastinate because you are afraid of success'.
- Tried various techniques.
- Sometimes don't know where to start, sometimes forgetting.
- Overwhelmed
  - Schpeel later.

### Overwhelmed

- Do a lot of things.
- Tasks: YouTube, Twitch.
- Creative work.
- Need to be hands-on.
- Keeping up with trends.
- Injustices in the world.
- Lack of security.
