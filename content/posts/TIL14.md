I personlly think that this a very good indicator given the lack of privacy awareness and profusion of android phones in India.
[^LPR]: <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/participationrate.asp> LPR is a measure of an economy’s active workforce. $$ \text{LPR} = \dfrac{\text{workers employed}+\text{people actively seeking employment}}{total noninsitutionalized working-age population}. $$
