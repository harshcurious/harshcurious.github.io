My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3966667595">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Pretty average. There are some impressive passages, with well flowing language. Overall didn't enjoy the story, and characterization. The ending was utterly bizarre. Disappointed. I guess the hype is because of the transgressive nature of the story, and not for its actual content.
