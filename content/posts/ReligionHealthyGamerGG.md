**Disclaimer**: I am not religious, so get ready for some personal opinions. These are not facts. Opinions can change with time.

Today I was watching the following video about religion's influence on mental health.
{{< youtube id="sc3ycMvyuoo" title="How Religion Affects Your Mental Health" >}}
And it is similar to my thought on religion. Much like Dr. K, I try not to judge people based on their religion. The atheiest community is prone to it.
